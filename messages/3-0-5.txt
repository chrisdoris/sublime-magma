Changes to syntax:

* The arrow '->' (usually seen in map constructs) is now a proper operator

* Supports hexadecimal integer literals

* Constructors now support parameters better

* New syntax file for 'spec' files (old version still available as 'Magma Spec (old)')

Changes to keybindings:

* Adds keybindings to '<', '>' and 'backspace' so that typing tuples behaves similar to how '()', '{}' and '[]' already behave in Sublime. Similarly adds keybindings to '*', '@' and '!' so that typing lists, multisets, indexed sets and multisets behaves nicely.

* Typing ';' on a blank line or immediately after ':=' now inserts a ';' but puts the cursor before it, assuming that the user is about to type an expression. Typing ';' immediately before a ';' moves through it, much like typing ')' before ')' moves through it.
